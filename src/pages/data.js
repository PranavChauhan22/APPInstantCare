    head:"How to turn FOMO into JOMO",
    body:"In the battle of FOMO vs JOMO, it’s time to declare a winner. Okay, let’s back up for those of you who had no idea there was a skirmish going on, or even what these two acronyms mean. FOMO is the fear of missing out; JOMO is the joy of missing out. And the two have sparred in our social brain for what seems like an eternity, but in recent history, Facebook, Instagram, and Tik Tok have brought the conflict to a whole new level.Yes, technology, we want to collectively thank you for the gift of being able to tap a button on our phone to have a car, a hot meal, or a hot date (hey, we’re not judging) delivered right to our door. But what are we supposed to do when that same device is beaming image after image of our high school frenemy’s enviable bachelorette weekend directly into our brain while our texting app sits ominously silent? [Asking for a friend.The only way to deal is to silence the FOMO and embrace the JOMO."

    body:"You know the feeling. It’s exhausting, it’s stressful, it’s obsessive: it’s FOMO. The fear of missing out, whether it’s sparked by a social media post or an in-person interaction, it’s a recipe for a rich stew of anxiety and discontentment.Here’s the big problem with FOMO. “You’re focused on what others are doing, rather than being fully present where you are,” explains Cathy Sullivan-Windt, Ph.D, a licensed psychologist & founder of the New Connections Counseling Center.So why is that so bad? Constantly distracting yourself with what others are doing sets up the groundwork for social comparison. And the biggest issue with this is that you’re comparing your reality with someone else’s curated depiction of reality. That skews your expectations for how things should be and can undermine your self-confidence, satisfaction, and enjoyment.And to make matters worse, your brain rewards you for engaging in social comparison when you come out on top in the situation. There’s also an almost addictive element where you can’t stop yourself from compulsively checking your phone to see what everyone else is up to."

    body:"Usually the conversation around inequality centers on things we can measure. We can see the disparity on just about every quantifier of equality:Income. In 2017 black men were paid less than 70 cents for every $1 paid to white men. Net worth. The white-black income gap in median net worth increased from $132,800 in 2013 to $153,500 in 2016.Employment rate. Black unemployment is consistently twice that of white unemployment.Health. Even the coronavirus is more likely to impact black Americans than white Americans.But what we can’t plot on a chart and see with the same clarity is the cumulative effect, not just of these stark contrasts, but of the everyday strains, known as microaggressions. The slight suspicion, nominal service, and dismissiveness that mark a more subtle form of racism have devastating consequences on mental health.According to research published by the American Psychological Association (APA), discrimination-related stress is linked to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression—even in children. This report doesn’t come as a surprise, but the severity of the problem may.In the APA’s Stress In America: The Impact of Discrimination report, American Indian/Alaska Natives (81 percent), Blacks (76 percent), Asians (74 percent) and Hispanics (72 percent) report having experienced everyday discrimination, compared to 61 percent of all adults.And over half of the black respondents (60 percent) added that their lives have been “at least a little harder because of discrimination."
